                result: "VIRAL PHENOMENON",
                explanation: "Wrapped generates billions of social media impressions annually with pure user-generated content. It became a cultural moment where NOT sharing your Wrapped feels like missing out. Competitors tried to copy it but none matched its impact.",
                lesson: "Give audiences something worth sharing about themselves. Personalization plus social sharing plus FOMO plus annual anticipation equals marketing gold."
